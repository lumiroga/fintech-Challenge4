# Fintech **Challenge 4**
---

This is the 4th challenge for Quantitative Analysis.


## Quantitative Analysis 

The Quantitative Analysis proved S&P 500 is out performing the remaining 4 funds.



## Analyze the Volatility

The Quantitative Analysis proved **BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC** is the most volatile fund and **Tiger Global** the least volatile


## Analyze the Risk

The Risk Analysis shows the S&P 500 has the most risk, meanwhile, the Berkshire Hathaway Fund is the most risky of the funds. The pattern doesn't change much when the Standard Deviation (risk) is annualized or in a 21 days rolling window.

## Risk Return Profile

The Risk Return Profile explains that even if Berkshire Hathaway is the most risky portfolio, it gives the best Sharpe Ratio, even better than S&P 500, so it is a better investment option at least from the current metrics.
